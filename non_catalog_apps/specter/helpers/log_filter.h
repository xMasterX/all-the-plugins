/* Filtering the logbook by entry type.
 *
 * The .txt logbook stores each finding as two lines - a timestamp, then an
 * indented "TYPE detail" - which reads well but makes a long log tedious to
 * scan when you only care about one kind of finding. Writing up a survey means
 * skipping every SWEEP line; checking what a Watch caught overnight means
 * skipping everything else.
 *
 * So the viewer can filter. Keeping a matched entry means keeping BOTH of its
 * lines: dropping the timestamp would strip a finding of the one thing that
 * makes it evidence.
 *
 * Pure and header-only so the firmware and the host tests share one copy. */

/* Copy only the entries whose detail line starts with `type` from `text` into
 * `out`. A NULL or empty `type` copies everything. Always NUL-terminates (as
 * long as out_len > 0) and never writes past out_len. Returns the number of
 * entries kept. */
