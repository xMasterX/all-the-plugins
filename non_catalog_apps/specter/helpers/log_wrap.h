/* Laying a logbook entry out for the on-device viewer.
 *
 * The entry was written as one long indented line, on the assumption that the
 * TextBox would wrap it sensibly. It does not - it wraps by CHARACTER, so a
 * Watch contact came out as
 *
 *     2026-09-21 12:19:28
 *       WATCH  contact 2 at 8s fiel
 *     d 17% peak 100% m:boost
 *
 * splitting "field" across lines and losing the indent that marks a detail as
 * belonging to the timestamp above it. Caught in a hardware screenshot.
 *
 * So wrap it here, at spaces, and indent the continuations. That second part is
 * what keeps specter_log_filter() working: it reads EVERY indented line after a
 * timestamp as part of that entry and keeps the whole entry when any of them
 * matches the type, so a wrapped detail is still one finding, and the type
 * still sits at the front of the first indented line where the filter looks.
 *
 * The .csv is untouched - it stays one flat row per finding, because a
 * spreadsheet wants a record, not a paragraph.
 *
 * Pure and header-only so the firmware and the host tests share one copy. */

/* Characters that fit one line of the viewer's TextBox. Empirical, from a 4x
 * device capture: "  WATCH  contact 2 at 8s fiel" is 29 characters and filled
 * the width exactly. The font is proportional, so a character budget is only a
 * proxy and 26 leaves room for a line of unusually wide glyphs. */
