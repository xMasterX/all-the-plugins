# Passy: Flipper Zero Passport Reader

**Passy** is a tool for reading electronic passports (ePassports/eMRTDs) using the Flipper Zero device. It extracts and decodes data securely stored in modern passports, designed for hobbyists, researchers, and security professionals.

---

## Features

- Reads and decodes ePassport data from a wide range of countries
- Utilizes MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) information for secure access
- Extensible for new country support—contribute your flag!
- Advanced menu for debugging and exploring additional data groups (DGs)

## Usage

eMRTDs are secured to prevent unauthorized reading. The key for accessing the data is derived from:

- Passport number
- Date of birth
- Date of expiry

**Use the Flipper Zero to scan your passport’s NFC chip and enter the required information.**

---

## Limitations

- Advanced menu is hidden unless Debug mode is enabled
- Some data groups (DGs) are not fully parsed under "advanced" menu
- Country coverage is limited (see above)

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Flipper Zero device (updated firmware recommended)
- [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) for building
- [asn1c](https://github.com/vlm/asn1c) ASN.1 compiler (for protocol/data parsing)

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bettse/passy.git
cd passy
```

Build the ASN.1 code (optional, required for development):

```bash
asn1c -D ./lib/asn1 -no-gen-example -pdu=all eMRTD.asn1
```

## Roadmap / To Do

- [ ] Support PACE protocol
- [ ] Add support for more countries' passports
- [ ] Improve parsing of additional DGs
