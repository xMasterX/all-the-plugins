# Flipper Zero Quadrastic Game

**Quadrastic** is a simple addicting game inspired by the [Arduboy game](https://community.arduboy.com/t/quadrastic-secure-the-point-avoid-the-enemies) of the same name. This, in turn, was based on a popular PSP homebrew game called [Squarez](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Squarez_PSP). Squarez itself drew inspiration from Ball, a game created by Nicolay Edin and Axel Hammarback, which was originally inspired by Eskiv, a game developed by Jean-François Geyelin.
