// Live tests loaded from the SD card.
//
// A test compiled as a .fal and dropped into the tests folder behaves exactly
// like one built into the app. That is the whole point of the LiveTestEnv
// contract: the plugin never links against a symbol of ours, so there is no
// second version of a test to keep in step with the first.
//
// Memory is the constraint that shapes this file. Reading a plugin's name
// means loading its ELF, and a user may have a folder full of them, so nothing
// here ever holds more than one plugin mapped at a time. Listing copies the
// metadata out and unloads immediately; running loads again and keeps that one
// alive only while the test is on screen.

// Where a user drops tests: /ext/apps_data/fake_chip_detector/tests. Created
// on first run so the folder is there to be found, rather than the user being
// told to make a directory whose name they have to guess.
