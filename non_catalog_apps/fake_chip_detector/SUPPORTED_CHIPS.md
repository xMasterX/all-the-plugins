# Supported chips

Every part **Fake Chip Detector** knows how to recognise, and exactly what it reads to
do it. Generated from [`chip_db.c`](chip_db.c) — the app and this table cannot disagree.

- **Register** — the ID register the app reads, with the datasheet name where the
  datasheet gives one. A four-digit register index means the chip takes a 16-bit
  register address (ST time-of-flight parts and Goodix touch controllers do).
- **Expected** — the value a genuine part returns. A mask means only those bits are
  compared; the rest are revision or configuration bits that legitimately vary.
- **Width** — how many bytes the value itself is.
- **Live test** — an ID register is one byte, and one byte is what a relabeller can
  copy. Where a module exists, the app offers to make the part *do* its job and prove
  it. See [LIVE_TESTS.md](LIVE_TESTS.md) for how to write one.
- Several rows in one cell mean the app checks all of them. Every one has to match
  before it will say GENUINE.

If your chip is missing, the app says so plainly rather than calling it a fake — see
[Adding a chip](#adding-a-chip) below.

## Chips with a factory ID register (51)

These can be verified. A mismatch here is real evidence that the part is not what the
label claims.

## Chips recognised by address only (29)

These parts carry no ID register at all — there is nothing to read, so no honest tool
can confirm which one it is. The app reports them as DETECTED rather than pretending
to a verdict it cannot support.

This is exactly where a live test earns its keep. For a chip in the table above, a
live test is a second opinion; for one down here it is the *only* evidence that can
ever exist, because asking the part to do its job is the one question left to ask.

## 1-Wire parts (15)

A different bus, on **pin 17**, and a weaker guarantee. Every 1-Wire part carries a
64-bit ROM code burned in at the factory, but any microcontroller can replay one, so
finding the expected ID proves a device is *present* — never that it is authentic. The
app says so on screen and never reports a 1-Wire part as GENUINE.

What it does prove is which **part** answered: the family code (the low byte of the ROM)
selects the command set and register layout, so a DS18S20 or DS1822 sold as a DS18B20 is
a fact here, not a suspicion. Temperature parts are taken one step further — the app runs
a real conversion and checks the scratchpad CRC, so it reports a working measurement
rather than mere presence.

| Family code | Part | What it is | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | **DS1990A/DS2401** | Serial number key | — |
| `0x04` | **DS2404** | Clock + memory | — |

| `0x42` | **DS28EA00** | Temperature sensor | temperature |
| `0x43` | **DS28EC20** | 20Kb EEPROM | — |

Family codes are from Analog Devices application note AN937 and the parts' datasheets.

## Adding a chip

Add an `IdCheck` array and one `ChipEntry` row to `chip_db.c`, rebuild, then re-run
`python tools/gen_supported_chips.py` from the repository root to regenerate this file —
that regeneration step is the only thing keeping the table honest. The rule
the database is held to: **every constant must come from the manufacturer datasheet or
the vendor's own driver.** A wrong expected value makes the app accuse a genuine sensor
of being counterfeit, which is far worse than not supporting the part at all. Anything
that could not be pinned down to a primary source was deliberately left out.

Cite the source in a comment, the way the existing entries do.
