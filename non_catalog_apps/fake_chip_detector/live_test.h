// An ID register is one byte, and one byte is exactly what a relabeller can
// program into a cheaper die. A live test asks the harder question: does the
// part actually *do* what that number promises? A magnetometer that tracks
// north, a barometer that moves when you cover it — those cannot be faked by
// a sticker.
//
// A test is one file. It can be compiled into the app, or built separately as
// a .fal plugin and dropped onto the SD card, and the source is identical
// either way. That is the reason for the shape of everything below: a test
// never calls a function of this app by name. The bus arrives as a table of
// pointers in LiveTestEnv, so the only symbols a test needs resolved are the
// firmware's own (furi_delay_ms, snprintf, memset). Nothing else has to be
// exported, and no part of this contract depends on how the test was built.
//
// Writing a test:
//   1. Add live_<part>.c/.h exporting `extern const LiveTest live_test_<part>;`
//   2. Fill in `chip` with the EXACT name string used in chip_db.c — that is
//      how the app finds your test after a scan — and `addrs` with every
//      address the part can sit at, so it can also be launched by hand.
//   3. Implement run(). Optionally implement draw() if plain text lines are
//      not enough; leave it NULL and you get a readable generic screen free.
//
// See LIVE_TESTS.md for the rules a test is held to and for how to build one
// as a loadable plugin.

// Bumped whenever anything below changes shape: the descriptor, the env, the
// bus table, or LiveTestState. A plugin records the version it was compiled
// against and the loader refuses to run one that disagrees, because the
// alternative is a test reading rubbish off the end of a struct it thinks it
// understands and reporting it as a measurement.
