		 * the end application to take that whole panel, however its laid out, and do whatever
		 * it wants to do with it. Write it to a file, convert, etc., etc., so that this module
		 * will forever return that it is printing until the callback returns true.
		 *
		 * Once we call the callback and it shows a true, then we can be sure the higher module
		 * is done with the buffer, and we can tell the host that yes, its done, you can continue
		 * if you want.
