feifan_0x370.py — reference for the 0x370 EPAS3P_sysStatus nag-suppression scheme.

Decoded from a 22,598-frame candump of a working in-the-wild commander
(V4.1.00) captured on X179 Bus 6 (pin 13/14) of a HW4 car while it was
successfully suppressing the steering-nag during FSD. Contributed by
@DrStrangeglovebox in issue #100.

The headline finding — and the reason a naive nag killer trips Tesla's 2026.14.x
preflight while this scheme does not — is that the working commander does NOT
flip a "hands on" flag. It transmits a *realistic steering torque* and lets the
car infer hands-on, while reproducing the genuine EPAS frame's rolling counter
and checksum exactly. The frame looks like EPAS, so the content check passes.

Frame layout observed (8 bytes, ~100 Hz):

    byte0   status nibble, alternates 0x11 / 0x12 (low nibble 1/2)
    byte1   torsion-bar torque, signed, random-walks around 0 (~ -5..+2)
    byte2   slow status, mostly 0x07 / 0x08
    byte3   second torque channel, signed, random-walks around 0
    byte4   bits[7:6] = handsOnLevel — LEFT AT 0 (never forced high);
            low bits a slowly-varying value around 0x1F-0x21
    byte5   high-entropy low byte (likely the fast byte of a 16-bit angle)
    byte6   rolling counter, low nibble 0x0..0xF, +1 per frame (high nibble 0)
    byte7   checksum

CHECKSUM (validated 22,598 / 22,598 frames, 100%):

    byte7 = (sum(byte0..byte6) + 0x73) & 0xFF

The additive constant 0x73 = 0x70 + 0x03, i.e. the low and high bytes of the
message id 0x370 — the classic Tesla "sum of payload + id bytes" checksum. Note
it is ARITHMETIC-additive, not XOR: changing only the counter by +1 raises the
checksum by +1 (a true CRC8 would not).

This module is the reference encoder for the v2.17 nag-killer redesign. Run with
a candump path to re-validate the checksum against a capture.

SAFETY: injecting steering torque during FSD carries risk. Test only in a safe,
empty area with hands ready. Severity note (@DrStrangeglovebox, #100): the
forced-disengagement / tripped-efuse behaviour was observed only on FSD v13 (an
error the car triggers), not v14, and the fuses reset on their own after the car
sleeps ~20 minutes — no service required. Less severe than first reported, but
still treat a disengagement as potentially leaving the car briefly unpowered.
This file is a research reference, not a ready-to-run injector.
