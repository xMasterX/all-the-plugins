> **Tesla FSD region-gate bypass for Flipper Zero.** Enables the FSD UI toggle for users who **already have an active FSD subscription or purchase** but are in a region where the "Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control" option is not exposed in the vehicle menu. HW3, HW4, Legacy HW1/HW2. FSD v14 ready. Also includes nag killer, ISA speed chime suppression, OTA guard, battery preconditioning trigger, and a live BMS dashboard — these work independently of FSD entitlement. Total hardware cost: Flipper Zero + Electronic Cats CAN Bus Add-On + OBD-II cable — or build the [$14 ESP32 port](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/tree/main/esp32) instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **An active FSD package is required for FSD features** — either purchased or subscribed. This tool enables the FSD functionality at the CAN bus level, but the vehicle still needs a valid FSD entitlement from Tesla. It is NOT a purchase bypass.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Tesla has begun issuing VIN-level bans** (April 2026). Affected vehicles lose the TLSSC toggle silently — no OTA, no warning, persists across account transfers and re-subscriptions. CAN injection cannot override a VIN ban. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [issue #18](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/18) for details. Non-FSD features (nag killer, BMS dashboard, diagnostics) are not affected.
>
> If FSD subscriptions are not available in your region, the upstream community documents a workaround: create a Tesla account in a region where FSD subscriptions are offered (e.g. Canada), transfer the vehicle to that account, and subscribe. See the [upstream documentation](https://gitlab.com/slxslx/tesla-open-can-mod-slx-repo) for details.
>
> Features like the Nag Killer, ISA Speed Chime Suppression, BMS Dashboard, and battery preconditioning work **without** FSD and do not require any subscription.

## Features

- Auto-detect HW3/HW4 from `GTW_carConfig` (`0x398` on legacy / `0x7FF` on Ethernet), or force manually — **note:** on 2020+ Model 3/Y HW3/HW4, `0x398` is on the Ethernet bus and may not appear on the CAN bus tap; use Force HW3 or Force HW4 if auto-detect doesn't find it
- **Legacy mode** for HW1/HW2 (Model S/X 2016-2019)
- FSD unlock via bit manipulation on `UI_autopilotControl` (`0x3FD` / `0x3EE`)
- Nag suppression (hands-on-wheel reminder)
- Speed profile defaults to fastest, syncs from follow-distance stalk
- Live status on Flipper screen

### Settings (runtime toggles)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mode** | `Active` / `Listen-Only` / `Service`. Listen-Only is the **first-boot default** as of v2.4 — the MCP2515 is put into hardware listen-only mode and physically cannot TX. Switch to Active when you're ready. |
| **Force FSD** | Bypass the `isFSDSelectedInUI` CAN-level check so frames are modified even if the car's Traffic Light toggle is absent. **This does not bypass Tesla's server-side entitlement verification** — it only affects the local CAN frame flow. Useful when the toggle exists in the car but is hidden by the region UI gating. |
| **Suppress Chime** | Kill the ISA speed warning chime (HW4 only, CAN ID `0x399`) |
| **Emerg. Vehicle** | Enable emergency vehicle detection flag (HW4 only, bit59) |
| **Nag Killer** | EPAS counter+1 echo on `0x370` (CAN 880 method, ported from upstream MR !44) |
| **Precondition** | Periodic `0x082 byte[0] = 0x05` inject to trigger BMS battery preheat. Same trick Tesla uses for Supercharger preconditioning. |

### HW Support

| Tesla HW | Bits Modified | Speed Profile |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Legacy (HW1/HW2) | bit46 | 3 levels (0-2) |
| HW3 | bit46 | 3 levels (0-2) |
| HW4 (FSD V14+) | bit46 + bit60, bit47 | 5 levels (0-4) |

> **Firmware warning:** 2026.2.9.x and 2026.8.6 — FSD is **not working on HW4**. Use HW3 mode on these versions even if your car has HW4 hardware. See [Compatibility](#compatibility).

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Description | Price |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [Flipper Zero](https://flipper.net/) | The multi-tool device | ~$170 |
| [Electronic Cats CAN Bus Add-On](https://electroniccats.com/store/flipper-addon-canbus/) | MCP2515-based CAN transceiver | ~$30 |
| OBD-II cable or tap | Connect to Tesla's Party CAN bus | ~$10 |

### Wiring

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/wiring_diagram.png" alt="Wiring Diagram" width="700">
</p>

> **Termination resistor:** Electronic Cats ships two revisions of this Add-On. v0.1 has the 120 Ω terminator enabled by default and you need to open the `J1 / TERM` solder jumper on the bottom of the board. v0.2+ ships with it already open. To check without opening anything, measure the resistance between the CAN-H and CAN-L screw terminals **before** plugging into the car: ~120 Ω = good (terminator off), ~60 Ω = open the jumper, open circuit = also fine. Full breakdown in [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md#termination-resistor--important-detail).

Alternative connection point: **X179 diagnostic connector** in the rear center console (Pin 13 CAN-H, Pin 14 CAN-L on 20-pin; Pin 18/19 on 26-pin).

### Other supported hardware

Don't have or don't want a Flipper Zero? An ESP32 port (PR [#6](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/pull/6)) brings the total cost down to **~$14 / ¥100** with a built-in WiFi web dashboard. Generic MCP2515 modules from Aliexpress also work with the Flipper Zero if you wire them by hand. See [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) for the full comparison + pin maps.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built FAP

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/releases)
2. Download `tesla_fsd.fap`
3. Copy to your Flipper's SD card: `SD Card/apps/GPIO/tesla_fsd.fap`

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the Flipper Zero firmware
git clone --recursive https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
cd flipperzero-firmware

# Clone this app into the applications_user directory
git clone https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd.git applications_user/tesla_fsd

# Build
./fbt fap_tesla_fsd

# Flash to Flipper
./fbt launch app=tesla_fsd
```

---

## Usage

1. Plug the CAN Add-On into your Flipper Zero
2. Connect CAN-H/CAN-L to the vehicle's OBD-II port
3. Open the app: `Apps > GPIO > Tesla FSD`
4. Select **"Auto Detect & Start"** (or force HW3/HW4)
5. Wait for detection (up to 8 seconds)
6. The app starts modifying frames automatically

### Screen Display

```
  Tesla FSD Active
  HW: HW4    Profile: 4/4
  FSD: ON    Nag: OFF
  Frames modified: 12345
       [BACK] to stop
```

### Activation Trigger

FSD activates when **"Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control"** is enabled in your vehicle's Autopilot settings. The app watches for this flag in the CAN frame and only modifies frames when it's set.

If your car is listed and you've tested, please leave a thumbs-up on the relevant issue so we can confirm.

### HW1/HW2 Legacy Support — Volunteers Needed

Older Model S/X vehicles (2016-2019) use a Mobileye-based architecture with different CAN IDs. The autopilot control frame is on `0x3EE` (1006) instead of `0x3FD` (1021), and the bit layout differs.

The logic is documented in the [Karolynaz/waymo-fsd-can-mod](https://github.com/Karolynaz/waymo-fsd-can-mod) CanFeather mirror (the original `Starmixcraft/tesla-fsd-can-mod` GitLab upstream has since been removed). We need someone with a HW1/HW2 car to validate it before we ship.

**If you have a 2016-2019 Model S/X with FSD and want to help:**

1. Hook up Flipper + CAN Add-On to OBD-II
2. Open the stock CAN sniffer app
3. Confirm CAN ID `0x3EE` (1006) appears on the bus
4. Capture a few frames and post them in [issue #1](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/1)

Once verified, Legacy support is a quick add.

## How It Works

Single-bus read-modify-retransmit on Party CAN (Bus 0). No MITM, no second bus tap.

1. ECU sends `UI_autopilotControl` (`0x3FD`) on Bus 0
2. Flipper catches it, flips the FSD enable bits
3. Flipper retransmits — receiver uses the latest frame

### CAN IDs Used

| CAN ID | Name | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `0x398` | `GTW_carConfig` | HW detection (`GTW_dasHw` byte0 bit6-7) |
| `0x3F8` | Follow Distance | Speed profile (byte5 bit5-7) |
| `0x3FD` | `UI_autopilotControl` | FSD unlock target (mux 0/1/2) |

---

## FAQ

**Does FSD stay unlocked after I unplug?**
No. It's real-time frame modification. Unplug = back to stock.

**Can this brick my car?**
Only UI config frames are touched. No writes to brakes, steering, or powertrain. Still — your car, your risk.

**Do I need the CAN Add-On?**
Yes. Flipper has no built-in CAN. You need the Electronic Cats board or any MCP2515-based module on the GPIO header.
