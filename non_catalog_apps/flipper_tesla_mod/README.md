> **Open-source Tesla CAN bus toolkit for Flipper Zero and ESP32.** FSD region-gate bypass, TLSSC Restore for VIN-banned cars, nag killer with organic torque variation, GTW Config Replay, live BMS dashboard, and 30+ CAN handlers across Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Supports HW3, HW4, and Legacy HW1/HW2. Free alternative to the $200+ S3XY Commander — total cost from **$14** with the [ESP32 port](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/tree/main/esp32).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **An active FSD package is required for FSD features** — either purchased or subscribed. This tool enables FSD functionality at the CAN bus level, but the vehicle still needs a valid FSD entitlement from Tesla. Non-FSD features (nag killer, BMS dashboard, diagnostics) work without any subscription.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Tesla has begun issuing VIN-level bans** (April 2026). Affected vehicles lose the TLSSC toggle silently — no OTA, no warning, persists across account transfers and re-subscriptions. The **TLSSC Restore** feature (v2.10+) can recover stop sign / traffic light control on banned Palladium and HW4 cars via 0x331 DAS config spoofing. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [issue #18](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/18) for the full ban research.

## Features

### Core FSD
- Auto-detect HW3/HW4 from `GTW_carConfig` (`0x398`), with fallback detection via `0x3FD`/`0x399`/`0x3EE` when `0x398` isn't on the tapped bus
- **Legacy→HW3 auto-upgrade** for Palladium Model S/X — detects `das_hw=0` then upgrades when `0x3FD` appears on the bus
- FSD unlock via bit manipulation on `UI_autopilotControl` (`0x3FD` / `0x3EE`)
- **Legacy mode** for HW1/HW2 (Model S/X 2016-2019)
- Speed profile defaults to fastest, syncs from follow-distance stalk

### TLSSC Restore (v2.10+)
- Recover Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control on **VIN-banned** vehicles
- Read-modify-retransmit on CAN ID `0x331` — sets `DAS_autopilot` to SELF_DRIVING
- Confirmed working on Palladium (Model S Plaid 2023), HW4 Highland (Model 3 Performance 2024), and Intel HW3 (with AP-first workaround)
- Does NOT restore full FSD visualization — only TLSSC (stop signs / traffic lights)
- **Recommended banned-car combination**: enable **TLSSC Restore** + **TLSSC bit38** (`0x3FD` mux 0 bit 38) together — confirmed reliable on HW3 / 2026.2.6 by @RoyRakete ([#18](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/18#issuecomment-4413430516)). Either toggle alone is unreliable on some banned firmware; the pair re-enables AP/TACC engagement

### GTW Config Replay (v2.9+, renamed from "Ban Shield" in v2.15)
- Watches `GTW_carConfig` (`0x7FF`) and replays the learned-healthy bus broadcast in real time when the gateway emits a modified frame
- Learns all 8 mux frames on first run, then auto-arms
- **What it actually does:** broadcast-layer mask only. When armed, the AP ECU sees the replayed healthy frame instead of the gateway's modified one. Tesla's ban writes to GTW NVRAM (which survives reboots) and to server-side flags; this feature does not undo NVRAM state or backend records, only what other on-bus ECUs see in real time.
- **What it doesn't do:** prevent bans, undo bans, or change Tesla's server-side entitlement record. No empirical case of ban prevention has been confirmed in 6 weeks of v2.9-v2.14 deployment. Honest framing per [#60](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/60) and [#67](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/67). The v2.14 name "Ban Shield" overpromised — the v2.15 rename reflects what the code actually does.

### Nag Killer (v2.1+)
- DAS-aware gating — only echoes when DAS is actually demanding hands-on, zero bus traffic when DAS is satisfied
- Organic torque variation — xorshift32 PRNG random walk in 1.00-2.40 Nm with grip pulse excursions to 3.10-3.30 Nm every 5-9 seconds
- **On-demand grip pulse (v2.15+)** — when `handsOnLevel` rises into a nag-demand state (0 imminent / 3 escalated), an immediate grip pulse fires and the periodic schedule resets. Closes the 2-second yellow-escalation window that could open between scheduled pulses on v2.14 and earlier
- EPAS counter+1 echo on `0x370` with level 0 (nag imminent) and level 3 (escalated alarm) suppression
- **Tap Party CAN (X179 pins 2/3) for the nag killer.** `0x370` is on Party CAN — not Vehicle CAN (9/10), and the gateway-forwarded Chassis copy (13/14) trips the 2026.14.x preflight. Confirmed working on HW4 2026.20 by tapping 2/3 ([#100](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/100)). A single-CAN board on the wrong pair has nothing to echo — the usual cause of "nag killer does nothing on HW4." Check your car's **Service Mode → CAN Port** page for which pin is Party on your harness; see [HARDWARE.md](HARDWARE.md).

### AP-First mode (v2.14+, for 2026.14.x firmware)
- Tesla 2026.14.x added a preflight check that blocks AP/TACC engagement if CAN injection is already active
- When **AP-First** is enabled, the app monitors `DAS_autopilotState` from `0x39B` and only starts injecting `0x3FD` after AP is engaged. On ESP32, the DAS status source follows detected HW version.
- Nag killer, TLSSC Restore, and GTW Config Replay are unaffected (they target different CAN IDs)

### 14.x firmware warning (v2.15+)
- **Default ON.** Flipper running scene replaces the BMS / flags line with `!14.x: TX may stop AP` whenever the warning toggle is enabled. ESP32 web dashboard shows a dismissible yellow banner at the top.
- Pessimistic default: most users on 14.x firmware don't know they're affected until autosteer disengages mid-drive. The warning reaches them before they enable any TX feature.
- Opt-out via the **On 14.x?** Settings toggle (Flipper) or the **Dismiss** button on the banner (ESP32, persisted in NVS). Disable if you are sure you're on pre-14.x firmware.
- Regional caveat: enforcement intensity varies by market. Some regions (markets without Tesla direct presence) appear to enforce less aggressively. See [#122](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/122) for the running 14.x / 2026.20 tracker.

### Diagnostics (read-only, no FSD required)
- Live BMS dashboard: pack voltage, current, SoC, temperature range, **energy consumption (Wh/km)**
- Vehicle speed, steering angle, motor torque, brake state
- DAS status: autopilot state, hands-on nag level, lane change state, blind spot warning, FCW, vision speed limit
- GTW autopilot tier readback (NONE/HIGHWAY/ENHANCED/SELF_DRIVING/BASIC)
- OTA detection with debounce — auto-suspends TX during firmware updates unless the explicit Ignore OTA override is enabled

### CAN Capture + Test Profiles (v2.16+)
- **CAN Capture** — record every received frame to the SD card in candump format (`apps_data/tesla_mod/captures/`). Read-only; safe to run on any car. Feeds `tools/tesla_crc_cracker.py`.
- **Send Test** — load a user-authored `.cantest` text profile from the SD card and replay your own frames. Defaults to dry-run; transmitting is hard-gated to a **parked, stationary** car (fail-closed) and re-checked before every frame. Result is logged for a bug report. Format + workflow: [docs/cantest-format.md](docs/cantest-format.md), example: [examples/example.cantest](examples/example.cantest).

### Settings (runtime toggles)

**Stable (car-tested):**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mode** | `Active` / `Listen-Only` / `Service`. Listen-Only is the **first-boot default** — MCP2515 is in hardware listen-only mode and physically cannot TX. |
| **Nag Killer** | DAS-aware EPAS counter+1 echo with organic torque variation. |
| **Force FSD** | Bypass the `isFSDSelectedInUI` check. Does not bypass Tesla's server-side entitlement — only affects local CAN frame flow. |
| **Ignore OTA** | Allows CAN TX in Active mode even when `0x318` reports a Tesla OTA update in progress. Default is off. |
| **TLSSC Restore** | 0x331 DAS config spoof to recover TLSSC on banned vehicles. Triggers MCU reboot. |
| **AP-First (14.x)** | Delay 0x3FD injection until AP is engaged. Required for Tesla firmware 2026.14.x. |
| **GTW Config Replay** | Replay learned-healthy `GTW_carConfig` (0x7FF) broadcasts when the gateway emits modified frames. CAN-broadcast-layer mask only — does not undo NVRAM or backend-side ban flags, does not prevent bans. Renamed from "Ban Shield" in v2.15 ([#60](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/60), [#67](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/67)). |
| **Suppress Chime** | Kill the ISA speed warning chime (HW4 only, `0x399`). On ESP32 this is active only after HW4 detection; Legacy/HW3 use `0x399` as DAS status instead. |
| **Emerg. Vehicle** | Enable emergency vehicle detection flag (HW4 only, bit59). |
| **Precondition** | Battery preheat trigger via `0x082`. |

**Beta (untested, please report results):**

| Setting | CAN ID | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **ScrollPress AP** | `0x3C2` mux=1 | **HW4-only, Service mode only.** Engages AP via a time-based, human-like scroll-wheel gesture (press ~250ms → scroll-up ~150ms → press ~250ms → scroll-up) on `swcRightPressed` (bits 12-13) + `swcRightScrollTicks` (bits 24-29), fired when `DAS_autopilotState` rises 0→1 — no `0x3FD` touch. First known 2026.14.x bypass; discovered + bench-verified on Highland HW4 / 2026.14.2 by @JakNo ([#43](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/43), timed flow [#82](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/pull/82)). HW3 disabled in v2.15 after @DmitroPanteliuk's emergency-brake report on Intel HW3 2026.14.6 |
| **Nav FSD Route** | `0x3F8` bits 13/48/49 | Enable nav-based FSD routing (EU/restricted regions) |
| **TLSSC bit38** | `0x3FD` mux0 bit38 | Explicit TLSSC enable; pair with TLSSC Restore (0x331) as the recommended banned-car combo |
| **Lane Graph** | `0x3FD` mux1 bit45 | UI_showLaneGraph — lane visualization on non-FSD tier |
| **Tier Override** | `0x7FF` mux=2 | Force GTW_autopilot to SELF_DRIVING (more aggressive than GTW Config Replay — actively writes rather than replays) |
| **Dev Mode** | `0x3F8` bit5 | UI_dasDeveloper flag |
| **Force LHD** | `0x3F8` bits 40-41 | UI_drivingSide signal override. **Empirically does not change FSD lane-side behavior** (tested on banned RHD HW3 / 2026.2.6 — values 0, 1, 2 all leave FSD on the LHD side; see [#66](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/66)). Likely a UI-only signal. **Slated for removal in v2.15** if no value-3 / DAS_settings counter-evidence surfaces |
| **Hands-Off** | `0x3F8` bit14 | UI-level hands-on disable (second nag vector) |
| **Telemetry Off** | `0x3F8` bit43 | Disable trip telemetry — may itself be a ban signal, use only with SIM pulled |

**14.x experimental (off by default, please report):**

These target Tesla 2026.14.x / 2026.20 behaviour and are all **off by default**. They are probes, not confirmed universal fixes — see [#122](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/122) for live status. Toggle in the ESP32 web dashboard (and Flipper Settings where available).

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Abort Guard** (ESP32) | Steer-jerk mitigation ([#108](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/108)). The activation jerk is the car *aborting* the engage (`DAS_autopilotState` → `8 ABORTING` → `9 ABORTED`). When on, cuts all activation injection the instant an abort state appears and stays off until a clean disengage. **Validated on-car:** eliminated the jerk on wide/straight roads (0 in hundreds of cycles, was ~1/25–30). Limit: some narrow roads jump straight to `FAULT (9)` with no lead, which it can't catch. |
| **Soft Engage** | Steer-jerk mitigation ([#108](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/108)). Holds the activation-edge injection until the wheel is within ±5° of centre. Needs `0x129` (steering angle) on the tapped bus; degrades to AP-First-only if absent. Largely superseded by Abort Guard for straight-road jerks. |
| **Nag Burst** | Echoes `0x370` in bursts (~1 s on / ~1.5 s off) instead of continuously ([#122](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/122)). The rest periods are the believed reason some in-the-wild devices evade the stricter 14.x nag detector. Pairs with a ±1.8 Nm steering-torque cap. |
| **EPAS-faithful (Mode-C)** | Demand-state torque model that mirrors a real EPAS instead of flipping `handsOnLevel` ([#100](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/100)). For cars where the standard nag killer trips the preflight. **Not yet confirmed on-car.** |
| **Signal Map** (ESP32 → advanced) | Override where the nag killer reads AP-state / hands-on / steering: `id + byte/shift/mask` ([#122](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/122)). For variants whose `0x39B`/`0x399` layout differs. Freshness-gated — a wrong map fails closed. Leave DAS id `0` for auto-detect. |

**Hardware:**

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MCP Crystal** | 16 / 8 / 12 MHz — match your CAN module's crystal frequency. |

### HW Support

| Tesla HW | Bits Modified | Speed Profile |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Legacy (HW1/HW2) | bit46 | 3 levels (0-2) |
| HW3 | bit46 | 3 levels (0-2) |
| HW4 (FSD V14+) | bit46 + bit60, bit47 | 5 levels (0-4) |

## Hardware

### Flipper Zero

| Component | Description | Price |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| [Flipper Zero](https://flipper.net/) | The multi-tool device | ~$170 |
| [Electronic Cats CAN Bus Add-On](https://electroniccats.com/store/flipper-addon-canbus/) | MCP2515-based CAN transceiver (v1.2 supported) | ~$30 |
| OBD-II cable or X179 pigtail | Connect to Tesla's CAN bus | ~$5-10 |

### ESP32 (from $14)

Full-featured ESP32 port with WiFi web dashboard, NVS settings persistence, deep sleep, and factory reset. Same CAN logic as the Flipper app.

The ESP32 firmware maps AP/DAS status by detected hardware version:

| Detected HW | `0x399` | `0x39B` | ISA speed chime |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Legacy HW1/HW2 | `DAS_status` | not used | disabled |
| HW3 | `DAS_status` | not used | disabled |
| HW4 | `ISA_SPEED` | `DAS_status` | enabled |

| Board | Cost | Build target |
|-------|------|-------------|
| M5Stack ATOM Lite + ATOMIC CAN | ~$14 | `m5stack-atom` |
| Lilygo T-CAN485 | ~$15 | `esp32-lilygo` |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-RS485-CAN | ~$18 | `waveshare-s3-can` |
| Generic ESP32 + MCP2515 | ~$6 | `esp32-mcp2515` |

See [`esp32/README.md`](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/tree/main/esp32) for setup, and [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) for the full comparison + wiring diagrams + X179 pinouts.

### Connection points

- **OBD-II** (under steering column) — Party CAN. May go silent in Drive on some Model 3/Y builds.
- **X179** (behind passenger kick panel) — recommended. Pin 13/14 = Bus 6 (mixed forwarding, stays active in all modes). See [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) for 20-pin and 26-pin pinouts.

## How It Works

Single-bus read-modify-retransmit on Party CAN. No MITM, no second bus tap.

1. Gateway/ECU sends a frame on the CAN bus
2. Flipper/ESP32 catches it, modifies the target bits
3. Retransmits — the receiver uses the latest frame

### CAN IDs

| CAN ID | Name | Direction | Role |
|--------|------|-----------|------|
| `0x331` | `DAS_autopilotConfig` | TX | TLSSC Restore — set tier to SELF_DRIVING |
| `0x370` | `EPAS3P_sysStatus` | TX | Nag killer — counter+1 echo with organic torque |
| `0x399` | `ISA_speedLimit` / `DAS_status` | TX/RX | ESP32 HW-dependent: Legacy/HW3 read DAS status here; HW4 uses ISA speed chime suppression |
| `0x3FD` | `UI_autopilotControl` | TX | FSD unlock — bit46/60 (HW3/HW4), TLSSC bit38, lane graph bit45 |
| `0x3F8` | `UI_driverAssistControl` | TX | Nav FSD route, hands-off, dev mode, LHD, telemetry (beta) |
| `0x3EE` | `UI_autopilotControl` | TX | FSD unlock — Legacy HW1/HW2 |
| `0x3C2` | `VCLEFT_switchStatus` | TX | ScrollPress AP — right-scroll injection on mux=1 (HW4, Service mode, beta) |
| `0x7FF` | `GTW_carConfig` | TX | GTW Config Replay + active tier override |
| `0x082` | `UI_tripPlanning` | TX | Battery preconditioning trigger |
| `0x398` | `GTW_carConfig` | RX | HW version detection |
| `0x318` | `GTW_carState` | RX | OTA detection (auto-suspend TX) |
| `0x399` | `DAS_status` (HW3/Legacy) / `ISA_speedLimit` (HW4) | RX/TX | HW-dispatched: pre-Highland HW3 reads as DAS_status (AP state + hands-on); HW4 keeps the chime-suppression write path |
| `0x39B` | `DAS_status` | RX | HW4 + Highland HW3 — AP state (for AP-First), nag level, lane change, blind spot |
| `0x132` | `BMS_hvBusStatus` | RX | Pack voltage / current |
| `0x292` | `BMS_socStatus` | RX | State of charge |
| `0x312` | `BMS_thermalStatus` | RX | Battery temperature |
| `0x33A` | `UI_ratedConsumption` | RX | Energy consumption (Wh/km) |

## FAQ

**Does FSD stay unlocked after I unplug?**
No. Real-time frame modification. Unplug = back to stock.

**Can this work without an FSD subscription?**
FSD features (TLSSC, traffic light/stop sign control) require the FSD entitlement from Tesla. Without it, the AP ECU has no neural network weights loaded. Non-FSD features (nag killer, BMS dashboard, speed chime suppress, diagnostics) work on any AP-capable car.

**What about VIN-level bans?**
Tesla has been banning VINs server-side since April 2026. The ban downgrades `GTW_autopilot` tier from SELF_DRIVING to ENHANCED and removes the TLSSC toggle. The **TLSSC Restore** feature (0x331) can recover stop sign/traffic light control on Palladium and HW4. See [issue #18](https://github.com/hypery11/flipper-tesla-fsd/issues/18) for the full research. **GTW Config Replay** (0x7FF, formerly "Ban Shield") can replay the learned-healthy configuration in real time, but only at the CAN broadcast layer — it does not undo the underlying NVRAM or server-side state.

**Flipper Zero vs ESP32 — which should I get?**
ESP32 is cheaper ($14 vs $200+), has WiFi dashboard, NVS persistence, and deep sleep. Flipper is more portable and has a built-in screen. Both run the same CAN logic. If you don't already own a Flipper, get the ESP32.

**Does this support Model S / Model X?**
Yes. Palladium S/X (2021+) is confirmed working with TLSSC Restore. Pre-2021 S/X with HW3 retrofit works via Legacy→HW3 auto-upgrade. HW1/HW2 Model S/X uses Legacy mode (`0x3EE`). Model S/X uses different BMS CAN IDs — BMS dashboard may show incorrect values.

**Can this brick my car?**
Only UI config frames are touched. No writes to brakes, steering, or powertrain. The app boots in Listen-Only mode by default. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full TX surface list.

**Do I need a Flipper CAN Add-On?**
For the Flipper: yes, any MCP2515-based module (Electronic Cats, generic boards). For ESP32: built-in CAN transceiver on most supported boards (M5Stack ATOMIC CAN, Lilygo T-CAN485, Waveshare S3).
