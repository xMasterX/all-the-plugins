/*
 * fsd_profile.h — user-authored CAN test profiles (.cantest).
 *
 * The goal is the simplest possible authoring loop: a plain text file the user
 * edits on any computer, one frame per line, in the SAME candump format that
 * CAN Capture writes — so a line copied straight out of a capture log can be
 * tweaked and replayed. The Flipper loads it from a menu, runs it (only when
 * the car is provably stationary), and logs the result for a bug report.
 *
 * Line format (whitespace-separated, # starts a comment):
 *
 *     # Name: my test
 *     3FD#1000000000004000  repeat=20  delay=100
 *     118#0000000000000000
 *     (1.234) can0 370#0000000000000000      <- a raw candump line also works
 *
 *   (0x229 SCCM_rightStalk is refused on load — see fsd_profile_id_blocked.)
 *
 *   ID#DATA      hex CAN id, '#', hex data bytes (0..8 bytes). A leading
 *                "(timestamp) bus " candump prefix is ignored if present.
 *   repeat=N     send the frame N times (default 1)
 *   delay=N      milliseconds between sends (default 50; "delay=100ms" also ok)
 *   # Name: ...   sets the profile's display name
