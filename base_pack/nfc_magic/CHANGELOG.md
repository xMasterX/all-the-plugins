# Changelog

## 2.0

Major release. Adds magic **Ultralight / NTAG (USCUID-UL)** support, and reworks the magic
**MIFARE Classic (Gen2)** wipe & clone with honest **Success / Partial / Fail** reporting.

### Added

- **Magic Ultralight / NTAG (USCUID-UL) support** — the app can now write, clone and wipe magic
  Ultralight-family tags, not just MIFARE Classic:
  - **Write / full clone** with the transport auto-selected from detection — **direct** (CUID/ATS,
    ISO14443-3 + `A2`) or **backdoor** (raw wakeup). ACK-only, continue-on-fail; the UID page is
    written last; live "Writing X/N" progress; **Partial Write** with a Details list of the pages
    that didn't take (and resume if the card is briefly removed mid-write).
  - **Wipe** to factory default.
  - **Auth with Password (PWD-AUTH)** to write protected/locked tags (single attempt, so it can't
    burn `AUTHLIM`).
  - **"Write anyway"** for tags that don't confirm as magic.
  - **Detection** of UL11 / UL21 (incl. Mikron "Ultra"), NTAG213/215/216, UL-C, UL-5, and
    backdoor-mode tags (both wakeup sequences), with a raw-config view for unrecognised presets;
    family-first scanner.
- **Gen2 / MFC wipe & clone now report Success / Partial / Fail** — a **Partial** screen plus a
  **Details** list of the exact blocks that couldn't be written/wiped (it was previously always
  "Success").
- **"No keys found"** screen when a wipe has no usable keys (instead of a doomed write-check).
- **Exit → menu** button on the Wipe / Write / Dump failure screens.

### Changed

- Gen2 / MFC wipe & clone outcomes are tracked **per block** (counts + the not-done block list).
- A wiped **block 0** preserves the card's real **SAK/ATQA** (a 1K mis-detected as 4K is no longer
  stamped 4K) and zeroes the UID.
- **Write-check warnings** reworked: one shared Gen2/Classic handler and consistent
  **Back / Next / Skip** buttons.
- Clearer rejection message for a cross-family wrong dump.

### Fixed

- **False "Success"** on a Gen2/MFC **wipe** with missing keys, and on a **clone** that could write
  nothing (unknown keys, or a read-only block 0).
- **Stale-key carry-over** between operations — the dictionary attack now re-reads the card fresh
  each time instead of replaying the previous tag's keys.
- **Per-sector → per-block** failure tracking — a read-only block 0 no longer reports the whole of
  sector 0 as failed.
- Dead **"Next"** button on a write-check warning whose first item wasn't the UID warning.
- Gen2 write-check **"Back"** did nothing (it targeted the wrong menu); the misleading **"Retry"**
  label → **"Back"** (the button always navigates back).
- **KeysDict** memory leak when backing out of a write-check.
- The wipe-failure screen could show **"No keys found"** for an unrelated failure (uninitialised
  scene state).
